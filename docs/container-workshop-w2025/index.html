      <google-codelab-step label="Downloading Visual Studio Code" duration="5">
        <p>Before we begin, we will need to install Visual Studio Code (VS Code for short!) which is a powerful text editor that can be extended to be used as an integrated development environment for many languages.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Go to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> website.</li>
<li>Download the executable file for your operating system.</li>
<li>Open it and run through the installation.</li>
<li>Once installed, open up VS Code.</li>
<li>Click on the 4 square button to open up the &#34;Extensions&#34; explorer as seen here (alternatively, press <code>ctrl</code>/<code>⌘</code> + <code>shift</code> + <code>x</code>):</li>
</ol>

      <google-codelab-step label="Connecting to Jetstream2 Instance" duration="15">
        <p>We have set up some computing instances for you to use on the Jetstream2 cluster that is run by Indiana University. In order to connect to your Jetstream2 compute instance we will need to first make sure that you can access your <em>Secure Shell (SSH)</em>, set up your SSH keys, and then connect to the remote compute instance.</p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Note 1:</strong> SSH works through public key cryptography which uses 2 keys - a public key which is given to a remote server and a private key which is kept locally on your laptop/desktop. To put simply, they are used to communicate between your laptop and server securely.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Note 2:</strong> For this workshop, you were sent a public (<code>container_workshop.pub</code>) and a private key (<code>container_workshop</code>). Click on the following buttons and save these keys in your <strong>Downloads</strong> folder to be used later on in this section:</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Getting your SSH Keys</h2>
<p>In order to even get started with connecting to a remote server, we need to get the SSH keys associated to that server.</p>
<p>There are 2 different sets of instructions to follow depending on your operating system but the end result will be the same!</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>macOS/Linux</h3>
<ol type="1" start="9">
<li>Find your terminal application and open up a new shell:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>macOS: <code>⌘</code> + <code>space</code>, then search &#34;terminal&#34;</li>
<li>Ubuntu: <code>ctrl</code> + <code>alt</code> + <code>t</code></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1" start="10">
<li>Next, run the following code to create a directory called <code>.ssh</code> which will exist at the location found using the command <code>echo $HOME</code> in Terminal:</li>
</ol>
<pre>mkdir ~/.ssh/</pre>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Note:</strong> You may get an error saying that the location or file already exists. If you do, you can proceed to the next step since the directory is already there!</p>
</aside>
<ol type="1" start="11">
<li>You will need to download the <code>container_workshop.pub</code> public key and the <code>container_workshop</code> private key that were sent to you before the workshop. Save them in your &#34;Downloads&#34; folder. Once you&#39;ve downloaded both of the keys, we will move them to the <code>.ssh</code> folder using the following command in terminal:</li>
</ol>
<pre>mv ~/Downloads/container_workshop.pub ~/.ssh/
mv ~/Downloads/container_workshop ~/.ssh/</pre>
<h3 is-upgraded>Windows</h3>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Press Start and search for &#34;Windows Powershell&#34;.  Click on it to open a new shell.</li>

</ol>
<pre>new-item %USERPROFILE%\.ssh -ItemType Directory</pre>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Note:</strong> You may get an error saying &#34;new-item : An item with the specified name ...\.ssh already exists.&#34;.  If you do, you can proceed to the next step since the directory is already there!</p>
</aside>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>You will need to download the <code>container_workshop.pub</code> public key and the <code>container_workshop</code> private key that were sent to you before the workshop.

      <google-codelab-step label="Small Interlude..." duration="15">
        <p>So while the container builds, let&#39;s take a step back and break this down...</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 406.50px" src="img/740a4620221ffee1.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Overview of what we have...</h2>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 510.50px" src="img/c4c47ee636b42522.png"></p>
<p>In essence, we use the VS Code text editor for the following 3 things:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Text/Code editing</li>
<li>Connecting to remote servers in the cloud</li>
<li>Connecting to containers whether on a remote server or on your local machine</li>
</ol>
<p>Today, we are working inside a remote Jetstream2 instance and you can currently watch your container being built on there. Containers help isolate any required system packages, programming language packages, and tools that your project requires from the rest of your system. This means that if your project has specific versioning requirements, these can be baked into your container via the container configuration files. But what are those files? They are...<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Dockerfile - the main configuration file that contains all your system, programming language, and tool setup written as code.</li>
<li>devcontainer.json - a file that integrates the container building and running process with VS Code and is part of the &#34;<a href="https://containers.dev/" target="_blank">Development Container</a>&#34; standard.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/a062348ce0ceaa1.png"></p>
<p>On their own, containers are usually managed via terminal using terminal commands of the containerization software in question. However, with the Dev Containers standard, we can easily delegate running and connecting to containers to the VS Code UI. We will discuss how to make adjustments to these files in a little bit.</p>
<p>We can take a look at the 2 files and note that they can be non-trivial to put together. This is why we created the devcontainer template that we used today to generate the project files. This creates an easily extendable configuration with well documented container files that can be modified to your liking as the complexity of your project develops which we will talk about next.</p>
<p>By now, your VS Code instances should look a little something like this:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/277fd9fd060d7149.png"></p>
<p>Click on the &#34;+&#34; icon next to the &#34;Dev Containers&#34; dialogue to open up a new terminal instance which will have a &#34;Jupyter Token&#34; pop-up once launched:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 463.50px" src="img/c78d545f8eade2f1.png"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/d318c2609e070b62.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p>Your container is now ready to use on Jetstream2! Note that the bottom left hand corner now says that you are working in a Dev Container.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Accessing JupyterLab and RStudio" duration="15">
        <p>We can do most of our editing in VS Code with extensions for Python, R, and other languages; however, our container comes with additional tool options that can be more conducive for data analysis such as JupyterLab and RStudio. Here, we will show how to access these container tools.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">

        <p>To show off the usage of development containers for reproducibility, we will do a small sentiment analysis on the famous &#34;To be or not to be&#34; speech from William Shakespeare&#39;s Hamlet. Containers give us a lot of flexibility on the type of packages and tools we can install using commands we are familiar with (<code>pip install ..., mamba install ..., install.packages(...)</code>). However, to create a reproducible project that can be shared and easily setup and built we need to make changes to our actual Dockerfile, the file that defines the entire computational environment.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Let&#39;s open up the <code>example.Rmd</code> file which has some starter code and functions for us to use. We can do this by selecting &#34;Files&#34; in the bottom right pane and selecting <code>example.Rmd</code>.</li>
</ol>

<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Inside this file you will notice a cell called <code>{r setup ...}</code>. Let&#39;s add a few packages underneath the knitr options:</li>
</ol>
<pre>```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(syuzhet)

knitr::opts_chunks$set(echo = TRUE)
```</pre>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Once we run this chunk, you&#39;ll notice that we have <code>ggplot2</code> but not <code>syuzhet</code>. We will need to add this package to our container files so that in the future, when this project is shared with others, it can be built and run without additional tweaking. More than that, we will do so in a manner that specifies the exact package version we wish to install. This is because by default, R will install the latest version of packages. There are times when doing so can break an installation due to either specific version requirements, dependency issues, or upstream changes in other packages. </li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 512.50px" src="img/e4adffeb28754cea.png"></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Reproducible Project – Finishing Up" duration="15">
        <p>Now that we have included the syuzhet package, we can finish up this little project! Below is the famous &#34;To be or not to be&#34; speech made by Hamlet. We will analyze and plot the sentiment of each line of this speech.</p>
<pre>To be, or not to be, that is the question: 
Whether &#39;tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That Flesh is heir to? &#39;Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there&#39;s the rub,
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There&#39;s the respect
That makes Calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,
The Oppressor&#39;s wrong, the proud man&#39;s Contumely,
The pangs of despised Love, the Law&#39;s delay,
The insolence of Office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th&#39;unworthy takes,
When he himself might his Quietus make
With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of Resolution
Is sicklied o&#39;er, with the pale cast of Thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment,
With this regard their Currents turn awry,
And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,
The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons
Be all my sins remember&#39;d.</pre>

      <google-codelab-step label="Basic Container Management" duration="10">
        <p>Let&#39;s say you end up using Docker quite a bit whether on your own personal computer or a remote server. What happens when you have a lot of containers? What if you want to get rid of some to clear up space? This is where the VS Code Docker extension comes in.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">

<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>In an instances where you may be done with a project you&#39;re working on or have a container that is somehow misbehaving, you can stop the container from running. We can achieve this by right-clicking and selecting the &#34;Stop&#34; option.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/a88277dca5cf0727.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="6">
<li>Once a container is stopped, we can then also remove it if we are done using it. Feel free to remove the container we built. This will not affect the project files and can be undone by simply going back and rebuilding the container from scratch.</li>

<li>From here, since we are done with our container, we can also clean up and delete some of the container images. We should keep the guacamole images as they are part of the Jetstream2 infrastructure but we can remove the vsc and quay images.

</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/6cb75cc3600611c7.png"></p>
<p>Most of these actions can be replicated via terminal by using Docker CLI. However, using the Docker extension makes some of the basic day-to-day management simple to accomplish.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img alt="Jetstream2" style="width: 328.00px" src="img/263d306519e0be42.png"></p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk a bit about the remote computing we were using today and how you could get access to it. Compute time on these instances is made available through the National Science Foundation&#39;s <a href="https://access-ci.org/" target="_blank">Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services &amp; Support</a> (NSF ACCESS) program which exists &#34;...to help researchers and educators, with or without supporting grants, to utilize the nation&#39;s advanced computing systems and services – at no cost.&#34;</p>
<p>While NSF ACCESS provides time in the form of credits, the actual compute instances we are using are through Indiana University&#39;s Jetstream2 supercomputing system. Jetstream2 aims to make research computing easy by providing access to instances, remote desktop, and resource management all through the browser. NSF ACCESS is not limited to Jetstream2 as there is a variety of <a href="https://allocations.access-ci.org/resources" target="_blank">resource providers</a> available to choose from. That said, if you want direct support, UCSB PSTAT provides support for Jetstream2 development container images that we used today!</p>
<p>To get started, visit <a href="https://access-ci.org/about/get-started/" target="_blank">the ACCESS website</a> and then:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Sign-up for an ACCESS account.</li>
<li>Complete required submission paperwork (more on that below).</li>
<li>Once approved, head over to <a href="https://jetstream-cloud.org/" target="_blank">the Jetstream2 website</a> and submit your approved allocation there.</li>
<li>From there, you will be able to login and access your Jetstream2 allocation as well as add additional people under your allocation for usage (especially useful for labs/groups with larger units)</li>
</ol>
<p>The number of units that you can apply to can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>For limited scale projects (dissertations, papers, general grad student work)</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission of abstract + sign-off from advisor required</li>
<li>EXPLORE (400,000 credits)</li>
</ul>
<p>For larger scale projects (research labs, classroom work, heavy compute)</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission of 1-3 page project proposal</li>
<li>DISCOVER (1.5 million credits), ACCELERATE (3 million credits)</li>
<li>MAXIMIZE (unlimited, 10 page proposal, application open twice a year)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of initial application, you can always apply for higher tier later!</p>
<p>Below is a table of various Jetstream2 instance sizes and how long they can be run continuously, without shutting down with 400K credits that graduate students can apply for. Today we were using the <strong>Large CPU</strong> system:</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Distributing Research" duration="10">
        <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 562.50px" src="img/9a4c83e0538f875e.png"></p>
<p>As the final part of the workshop, we want to draw your attention to some helpful resources for maintaining and publishing your research code. In the digital age, distributing research effectively and efficiently is paramount for ensuring reproducibility, collaboration, and accessibility. This section will discuss how you can leverage GitHub and GitHub Codespaces for code management and execution, along with Zenodo for comprehensive research archiving.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Using GitHub for Code Management</h2>
<p>GitHub is a powerful platform for version control and collaboration, essential for managing research code. By storing your research code in a GitHub repository, you benefit from features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and continuous integration. These tools enable you to manage contributions from multiple collaborators seamlessly and ensure that changes are tracked meticulously.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>GitHub Codespaces</h2>
<p>GitHub Codespaces takes collaboration a step further by providing a full development environment in the cloud. This allows researchers to work on their projects from anywhere, without the need to set up local development environments. The key to making this work efficiently is the use of <code>.devcontainer</code> configuration files. This eliminates the &#34;it works on my machine&#34; problem, significantly enhancing reproducibility. </p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://github.com/UCSB-PSTAT/devcontainer-demo" target="_blank">demo repository</a> with which we can launch a GitHub Codespaces instance if you have a GitHub account. Simply click on &#34;Code&#34; then &#34;Codespaces&#34; and lastly &#34;Create codespace on main&#34;:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 360.66px" src="img/ec99acf0b097d4ed.png"></p>
<p>It should be noted that to use GitHub Codespaces, you need a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans#github-pro" target="_blank">GitHub Pro</a> account. Fortunately, GitHub offers GitHub Pro for free to educators, which makes this a cost-effective solution for academic research. </p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Archiving with Zenodo</h2>
<p>While GitHub is excellent for code management, it is equally important to have a robust system for archiving the entirety of your research output. This is where <a href="https://zenodo.org/" target="_blank">Zenodo</a> comes into play. Zenodo is a research repository managed by CERN that provides a secure and reliable platform for storing a variety of research outputs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research Papers</strong>: You can upload preprints or published versions of your research papers, ensuring they are freely accessible and citable.</li>
<li><strong>Research Code</strong>: Zenodo integrates seamlessly with GitHub allowing you to archive your code alongside your paper.</li>
<li><strong>Research Data</strong>: Zenodo supports the storage of research data, including confidential data that has been anonymized. This ensures that your datasets are preserved and accessible for future studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, by using Zenodo, you can generate DOI links for your research outputs, which enhances their visibility and citability. This is particularly important for ensuring that your work is easily discoverable and can be referenced by other researchers in the field.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/4276cb607594d7a3.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Combining GitHub and Zenodo</h2>
<p>The combination of GitHub and Zenodo provides a powerful ecosystem for distributing research:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><strong>Version Control and Collaboration</strong>: Use GitHub to manage and collaborate on your research code.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducible Development Environments</strong>: Utilize GitHub Codespaces with .devcontainers to ensure consistent development environments across all contributors.</li>
<li><strong>Archiving and Citability</strong>: Link your GitHub repositories to Zenodo to archive your code and generate DOI links for all your research outputs, ensuring they are preserved and citable.</li>
</ol>
<p>This integrated approach not only enhances the reproducibility of your research but also ensures that your work is accessible and can be built upon by the wider research community. By leveraging these tools, you contribute to a more open and collaborative research environment, ultimately advancing scientific discovery.</p>
